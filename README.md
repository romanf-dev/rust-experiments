Rust experiments
================

linked_list
-----------

Yet another attempt to implement C-style intrusive doubly-linked list using raw pointers. It relies on aliasing, so perhaps it is not so good idea to do it in Rust.

mcu_bare_metal
--------------

Minimal Rust application for STM32 MCU. It doesn't use any external crates.
